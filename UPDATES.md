## Discrepancies
Below is the list of the differences I found between the original keyboard design (https://gitlab.cairn-devices.eu/cairntech/cairn-mesa-key/-/tree/main/) and the new modified designs.

### 1. Top Case
Original top case was 1.36mm in the modified version it's seems to be 2.5mm thick

### 2. Bottom Case
The bottom case looks simpler and does not have these elements where you would glue some rubber feet, so it does not move on the desk.
Also the thickness seems different. See measurements on the pictures:

Can we update the bottom case to match the thickness and additional elements of the original?


### 3. The bottom design plate
The bottom design plate is also different in thickness. Original was 1mm thick, whereas the modified is 1.84mm thick.

### 4. Anything else?
If there is something else different, which I am not awere of, or did not find, can you also update that to the original size, please.

Can we make it such that the modified keyboard is more alliged with the original one bulkyness.
Overally it should have a look and feel the same as the original design shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPw4IiiNRL8


## Question
When I order the keyboard case, there are all these screws, inserts, adhesive, isolation etc, which we did not copy over from the original keyboard repository.
So when ordering from PCBWAY there is this "inserts" section there (see image below).
Should I add everything from this link https://gitlab.cairn-devices.eu/cairntech/cairn-mesa-key/-/tree/main/Mechanics/CAD/Solidwork%20files in that section as one zip file or how should I do it?
